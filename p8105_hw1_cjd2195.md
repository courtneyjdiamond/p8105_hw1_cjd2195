## Problem 1

First up: let’s load our moderndive library and load the
“early_january_weather” dataset. I will also go ahead and look at the
help file for this dataset to learn more about its components and
structure.

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
?early_january_weather
```

This dataset has 15 different variables! They are:

- origin: where the measurement was taken
- year: year the measurement was taken
- month: month the measurement was taken
- day: day the measurement was taken
- hour: hour the measurement was taken
- temp: temperature in F
- dewp: dewpoint in F
- humid: relative humidity
- wind_dir: wind direction, in degrees
- wind_speed: wind speed, in mph
- wind_gust: wind gust speed, in mph
- precip: precipitation, in inches
- pressure: sea level pressure, in millibars
- visib: visibility, in miles
- time_hour: date and hour of the recording as a `POSIXct` date

To find out how big our dataset is, we could look at the help file, but
I’ll also call some R functions to help me figure it out.

``` r
nrow(early_january_weather)
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

There are 358 rows in the dataset, and 15 columns in the dataset.

We can also do some simple investigative analyses with these data, like
assessing the mean recorded temperature. In this case, we can check the
mean temperature. First I’ll save the data to a dataframe, which means
I’ll also need to load the tidyverse library.

``` r
library(tidyverse)

early_jan_weather_df = tibble(
  early_january_weather
)

mean_temp = mean(pull(early_jan_weather_df, temp))
```

The mean temperature is 39.5821229 degrees F.

Lastly, let’s check out a quick visualization of our temperature data
over time to see if we can observe anything.

``` r
ggplot(early_jan_weather_df, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

This plot appears to show some sort of cyclic pattern in which
temperatures rise and fall over short intervals (probably daytime
vs. nighttime temperatures), but gradually over the span of all data
collected, temperatures were on the rise. The minimum temperature
ovserved was below 25degrees, and the maximum was above 55degrees.
Across the data, we see mostly drier measurements with respect to
humidity, but there are some stretches where humidity appears to raise
to close to 100% (likely indicating some sort of precipitation).
